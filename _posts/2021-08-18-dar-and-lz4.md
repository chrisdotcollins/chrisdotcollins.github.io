# Data Storage #

Breaks down into two tasks:
* Compression of large data files / sets to reduce on disk storage or improve transfer speed
* Consolidate many file directories into a more managable single file for archiving/moving.


# Compression #
Looking at reducing the storage space of some large datasets which was effectively cold / pre-delete. Usually I'd go for gzip as it is available pretty much everywhere and seems relatively quick and efficient. However, looking at this particular dataset gzip was taking a fair amount of time to compress a single file, so would have taken an age to compress a large (hundreds or even thousands of files) dataset.

Using a typical file from the dataset I was working at the time, I started to investigate the different options, namely the familiar gzip and bz2, the increasingly popular xz and then a new one to me, lz4. The original file was about 12GB in size, and the benchmark to work against (gzip) was 12 minute compress time to create an 8GB output.
